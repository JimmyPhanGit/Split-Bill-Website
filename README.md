**Split Bill Website**

**Overview**

Split Bill Website is a modern web application designed to make splitting group bills fast, fair, and easy. As more restaurants and venues move to a "one bill per table" policy—often for credit card points or operational efficiency—this tool helps automate the process of dividing costs among friends, family, or colleagues.

This project was inspired by my own day-to-day experiences: I often find myself picking up the bill and then manually calculating what everyone owes, including tip and tax. This app streamlines that process, saving time and reducing errors.

**Features**

Dynamic Bill Splitting: Enter the total number of people, and the app generates sections for each person.
Custom Names & Items: Assign names and add as many items as needed for each individual.
Automatic Calculations: Tip and tax are calculated per person and for the entire bill.
Receipt Preview: See a real-time, itemized receipt that updates as you enter information.
Mobile Friendly: Responsive design for use on any device.
Easy Adjustments: Add or remove items, change names, and instantly see updated totals.

**Why I Built This**

With the rise of single-bill policies and the desire to maximize credit card rewards, splitting bills has become a regular part of my social life. This tool automates a task I do almost every day, making it easier for everyone at the table to see exactly what they owe.
